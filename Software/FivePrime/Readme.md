FivePrime is a method devloped by the Regev and Levin labs at Broad Institute. Here we only included codes that we modified, in order to run our pipeline on multiple methods. The original code can be retrieved from [GitHub](https://github.com/seanken/FivePrime).

Modified parts:
* `PeakCallingPipeline/SmallPipeline.sh`: Removed downsamping process
